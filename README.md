# multi_face_detection_et_track
This is part of my thesis project, the detectors mainly use what 5 different detection models with different Model(Meta_Architecture), different backbone(Feature Extractors) and different dataset to fine-tuning the exists pre-trained models on COCO dataset.

The tracking part is to use Kalman filter for the state estimation and Hungarian Algorithm to associate each frames for different Face ID
